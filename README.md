# WealthDesk -- In-Class Build

**Agentic AI Engineering, Batch 1 (June 2026)**

WealthDesk is the AI banking assistant for Bharat National Bank (BNB) that you build
session by session across the first 16 sessions of the course. By Session 16 it is a
multi-agent system with a Streamlit UI, ChromaDB RAG, SQLite tool calls, MCP integration,
compliance filtering, LangSmith observability, and a Docker deployment.

## Getting Started

**Step 1 -- Fork this repo** (click Fork at the top right on GitHub). This gives you your own copy where you can save your work.

**Step 2 -- Clone your fork** (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username):
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wealthdesk.git
cd wealthdesk
```

**Step 3 -- Add the instructor repo as upstream** so you can pull new session files before each class:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ketanvj/wealthdesk.git
```

**Before each session**, pull the latest starter files:
```
git pull upstream main
```

**After working in class**, save your code to your fork:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Session X work"
git push
```

## What You Need Before Session 1

1. Python 3.11 or later
2. A Groq API key (free tier): https://console.groq.com/keys
3. VS Code with the Python extension

**Setup (run once, before Session 1):**

```
# Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual Groq API key

# Mac/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual Groq API key
```

**Seed the database and vector store (run once, before Session 1):**

```
python data/seed.py
python data/ingest.py
```

**Verify your setup:**

```
python test_setup.py
```

All checks should show OK. Take a screenshot and post it in the WhatsApp group.

## Session Map

| Session | Story | What You Build |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-S1 | US-00 | Data layer: SQLite + ChromaDB setup (seed.py, ingest.py) |
| S1 | US-01 | Terminal chatbot with single-turn Groq + LangGraph |
| S2 | US-02 | Multi-turn memory with SQLite checkpointer |
| S3 | US-07 | Query routing: SIMPLE vs COMPLEX, RM escalation |
| S4 | US-03 | ChromaDB RAG: policy document retrieval |
| S5 | US-04 | SQLite tool calls: live rate and branch lookup |
| S6 | US-05 | Baseline evaluation: 40-question golden dataset, LLM-as-judge |
| S7 | US-06 pt.1 | MCP server setup and tool wrapping |
| S8 | US-06 pt.2 | Agent calls tools via MCP protocol |
| S9 | US-08+10 | Compliance filter (SEBI/DPDP) + LangSmith tracing |
| S10 | US-11 pt.1 + US-09 | Multi-agent: Supervisor, Documents Agent, Rates Agent |
| S11 | -- | Industry guest session (no build) |
| S12 | US-11 pt.2 | Multi-agent system complete: perf gate + Streamlit skeleton |
| S13 | US-12+16 | Streamlit UI + Human-in-the-Loop approval |
| S14 | US-14 | Security and guardrails (OWASP LLM Top 10 + DPDP Act) |
| S15 | US-13 | Dockerfile + Docker run + cloud deployment |
| S16 | US-15+17 | Advanced eval + data flywheel + prompt versioning |

## Running the Tests

```
# From the wealthdesk/ directory -- run one session at a time:
pytest s01/tests/ -v
pytest s02/tests/ -v
pytest s03/tests/ -v

# Tests do not require a live Groq API key -- the LLM is mocked.
```

Note: always run one session's tests at a time. All sessions use a file named
`main.py`, so running multiple sessions together (e.g. `pytest s01/ s02/`) can
cause the wrong `main` to be patched. Per-session runs are always correct.

---

## Important Rules

- Never commit your `.env` file. It contains your API key.
- Always run scripts from the `wealthdesk/` directory, not from inside a subfolder.
- If you accidentally expose an API key on GitHub, rotate it immediately at the provider's console.
- When in doubt about a rate or policy, the database is the source of truth -- not the documents, not the system prompt.

## Getting Help

Post in the Batch 1 WhatsApp group. Include: the error message, which script you were running,
and which operating system you are on.
